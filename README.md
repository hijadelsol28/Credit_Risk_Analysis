# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
This project uses the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company to analyse credit risk for LendingClub. Using oversampling and undersampling algorithms, we resampled the dataset, viewed the count of the target classes, trained a logistic regression classifier, calculated the balanced accuracy score, and generated a confusion matrix.
Specifically, we:
 - oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
 - Undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
 - Used a combinatorial approach of oversampling and undersampling with the SMOTEENN algorithm.
 - Compared two machine learning models that reduce bias: BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
 
## Results
The results of each analysis are listed below:
